Problem Restaurant Menu Selection

You are tasked with creating a program for a restaurant that allows customers to place an order. The menu consists of three items

1. Burger - $5.00
2. Pizza - $8.00
3. Salad - $4.50

The program should repeatedly display the menu and prompt the user to select an item until they choose to exit. After each selection, the program should calculate and display the total cost of the order. If the user enters an invalid choice, the program should inform them.

12.Karl David Z. Ocfemia
Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to a given positive integer n. You should use a loop to iterate through the numbers and add the even ones to the sum. Then, print the result.
For example, if n is 10, the program should calculate and print the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10, which is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30.

User entered 3 It will display “You entered 3”
User entered a number  3 It will display “Invalid choice” “Number is greater than 3”

14. Nathaniel O. Samson

Nathan wants to find out the total sum of numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5 below a number he input.

For example he input 10 there are 3,5,6,9 so the output will be 23 (the sum of numbers divisible by 3 and 5).

What will be the sum if he inputs 1000 for example

Create a program that asks the user of 2 numbers. The square (Formula N^2) 
should be calculated for the first number given and the second number should be multiplied by 5. The product of both the first and second numbers given should be summed up and displayed along with “BING CHILLIN!” if it is a multiple of two and “BRUH MOMENT!” if its not. Have fun, hooman.

20. Chester Bibon Create a number guessing game. It has a 5 guess limit. If the user reaches the guess limit, the program will end and will display “You win” or “You lose” in either scenario. However, create another option where the user can ask a hint about the number that is asked. In addition, create a code where the program can check whether the user input was really a number. If not, it should loop infinitely until the user input a number(make sure it doesn’t add up to the guess count). Make use of the following
cin.clear();
cin.ignore(numeric_limitsstreamsizemax(), ‘n’);
